# Voice Conversation

Operit AI supports real-time voice conversations with characters, bringing you a more immersive and natural interactive experience.

## Starting Voice Conversation

In the conversation interface with a character, you can easily start voice chat.

As shown in the image above, simply click the **microphone icon** in the lower right corner of the input box to enter voice conversation mode.

## Conversation Mode Switching

To adapt to different usage scenarios, we provide two voice conversation modes:

### 1. Push-to-Talk

After entering voice mode, **push-to-talk** is the default.

You need to long-press the microphone area at the bottom of the screen to start speaking, and release to send the voice to the character. This mode effectively prevents accidental triggering and background noise interference.

### 2. Auto-Listen

If you want a smoother continuous conversation, you can switch to **Auto-Listen** mode.

**Operation Method**: In the voice conversation interface, **click the character's avatar** to switch between "Push-to-Talk" and "Auto-Listen" modes.

In Auto-Listen mode, the app continuously detects your voice, allowing you to freely talk with the character without any button operations.

## Floating Window Mode

To allow you to keep conversing with AI while operating other apps, voice chat supports floating window mode. In the voice conversation interface, click the **function button** in the lower right corner to minimize the conversation window into a floating window, ready at any time.

## Reading Optimization

To enhance the listening experience of voice conversations, the system automatically applies the cleanup regex rules configured in [TTS Settings](/guide/character-system/tts-reading).

These rules can remove Markdown symbols, redundant punctuation, etc. from the character's replies, making the voice sound more natural.
