## üöÄ Advanced Usage in Practice

*(This section will show you through practical cases how to use advanced features such as extension packages and planning mode to complete more complex tasks.)*

### üß∞ Out of the Box
*This section covers **built-in packages***

When you ask AI to write software, the software's performance depends on AI's capabilities. The model in the examples is `Deepseek-R1`.

#### Example: Write a 2D Bullet Hell Game
Through simple dialogue, have AI conceptualize and implement a classic 2D bullet hell shooting game for you. Operit AI can call its basic coding capabilities and build complete game logic and dynamic graphics from scratch using only HTML and JavaScript.

#### Example: Write a 3D Game with HTML Code
Without any extension packages, Operit AI can directly use its built-in core tools to present a dynamic 3D game scene for you with HTML and JavaScript code.

#### Example: Simple Video Processing
Similarly, the app has built-in powerful FFmpeg tools. Without additional installation, AI can help you complete various processing tasks such as video format conversion, clipping, and merging.

#### Example: Software Packaging and Deployment
From writing code to final release, Operit AI can further call platform tools to package completed software into executable files suitable for Android (APK) or Windows (EXE), realizing an end-to-end automated development process.
