### About Prompt (Character Card) Configuration

   In our chat conversations with AI, we usually use something called "prompts" for a better chat experience and usage. It's like giving the AI a decree or label to execute. These prompts, through preset personalities, tones, and knowledge scopes, allow AI to quickly enter a specific role, just like choosing character skins in a game~ Different prompts bring completely different chat experiences.

   We have upgraded traditional "prompts" to "character cards", making each AI character like a complete identity card with richer personality and background settings. Users only need to select their favorite character card to immediately start a unique conversation journey!

Next, we'll teach you how to configure it.
