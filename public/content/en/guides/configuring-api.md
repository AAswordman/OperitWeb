### How to Configure Your Own API/Other Models

#### Configuring Your Own DeepSeek API
*Following these steps, you can easily configure DeepSeek's API for use in Operit AI.*

If you want to configure your own API (rather than using the default interface provided in the app), you can refer to the following process:

##### Step 1: Login/Register on DeepSeek Open Platform
First, you need to visit the DeepSeek Open Platform and log in to your account. We have embedded the DeepSeek open platform within the software. If you are using it for the first time, you need to complete registration first.

##### Step 2: Recharge to Get Credit
API calls consume account credits. You can complete the recharge following the guidance in image 5. Even with just a small amount of recharge (e.g., 1 yuan), it's enough for you to experience the V3 model for a long time.

##### Step 3: Create and Copy API Key
After successful recharge, please click the "Create API" button on the left. **Please note: The key is only fully displayed once during creation. Make sure to copy and keep it safe immediately.**
