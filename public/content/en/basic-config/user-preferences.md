### User Preference Configuration

In Operit AI, memory, knowledge base, and other features are bound to specific user preference configurations. By creating new user preferences, you can isolate AI's memory and knowledge for different tasks or scenarios, achieving a more personalized and focused AI interaction experience.

#### Parameter Introduction

The following are user preference parameters you can configure. These are all **optional**; you can fill them in according to your needs to help AI serve you better. Not filling them in will not affect basic usage.

*   **Date of Birth:** Helps AI understand your age group so it can better align responses with your life background and cognitive habits.
*   **Gender:** Makes it convenient for AI to use more appropriate forms of address and tone when communicating with you.
*   **Personality Traits:** You can describe your personality, such as "introverted", "cheerful", "likes to think". This allows AI to adjust its interaction style to better match your preferences.
*   **Identity:** You can fill in your role or identity here, such as "student", "father", "sci-fi enthusiast", and AI will provide more targeted information based on this identity.
*   **Occupation:** Informing AI of your professional field helps AI provide more accurate and professional knowledge when answering profession-related questions.
*   **AI Style:** You can define the style you want AI to exhibit, such as "rigorous and professional", "humorous and witty", or "gentle and considerate", and AI will try to imitate this style in conversations with you.

#### Creating Independent User Preferences

Users can isolate AI's memory by **creating new preferences**.

**Description:**
*   **Unlocked State (ðŸ”“):** In this state, AI maintains learning ability. It will continuously update and improve its impression of you (i.e., various parameters in user preferences) based on conversations with you, while also enriching the knowledge base bound to this preference.
*   **Locked State (ðŸ”’):** In this state, the current user preference configuration and the associated memory bank become **read-only**. AI will stop updating information based on new conversations, ensuring the current preferences and memories are not changed.
